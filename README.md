# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing, and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis, and implementation of software systems. Programming is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems.
Software development lifecycle(SDLC) is a step-by-step process of developing a software. It includes phases such as: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The various phases of SDLC include:
- Planning and Analysis: this is where you gather the business requirements from your clients or stakeholders.
- Requirements: this phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and        analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. It takes into account the user needs(the problem) and system requirements(solution).
- Design: this is where you can flowchart how the software responds to user actions.It also includes the development of a prototype model.
- Implementation: this phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product.
- Testing: this phase ensures that the software is functioning properly and does what it's meant to do. It can also help expose any major user experience issues and security issues.
- Deployment: this is where you deploy your final product to your intended user.
- Maintenance: this is where you continously monitor for vulnerabilities and update software with security patches.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to changes immediately. Suitable for long term projects.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases eg requirements, design, and implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall. Suitable for short term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
Helps ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
- Unit testing: This type of testing uses tests for a single component or a single unit in software testing and this kind of testing is performed by the developer.
- Integration tetsing: Integration testing means combining different software modules and phases and testing as a group to ensure that the integrated system is ready for system testing or not, and there are many ways to test how different components of the system function at their interface.
- System testing: System testing is the final test to identify that the system meets the specification and criteria and it evaluates both function and non-functional needs for the testing.
- Acceptance testing: Acceptance testing aims to evaluate whether the system complies with the end-user requirements and if it is ready for deployment.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control tracks the progress of code across development and iterations and also aids in managing lifecycle changes.
An example is git. Features include commiting code, pushing, pulling, and updating.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager's responsibilities are to analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life, are all issues that must be considered in developing and delivering computer software systems.
Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest. Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
By actively engaging in conversations about ethical considerations, prioritizing accountability and risk assessment, and advocating for diversity and inclusion, software engineers can take a more active role in protecting those affected by the solutions they build.
